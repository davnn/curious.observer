# curious.observer

This blog has been moved to [curiousobserver](https://github.com/davnn/curiousobserver) and is now Hakyll based 👍🏼.
The change to Hakyll is ironical - the Jekyll version was more advanced at pretty much everything. What was more advanced?

- Super-awesome frontend development with Webpack (including better CSS-Optimization and Autoprefixer)
- Tagging (could simply be implemented in Hakyll, but I didn't see the value of it)
- Better SEO (only minor)
- Including Jupyter snippets and output directly in posts

I'm happy that I was able to remove all the cruft, the new blog is based on one thing: simplicity.
