"A blog is the perfect medium to share ideas with the world. It's a place to test your own knowledge by explaining it to others. This article should save you some time when you decide to create or extend your own blog."

It's interesting how the blogging landscape has changed in recent years. Most blogs a couple of years ago used Wordpress or similar tools, which seem pretty complex for something that should be simple. [The rise of static site generators](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/) is a movement away from database-driven sites to simple static web pages. Things you essentially get for free with static websites are performance, reliability, security, and easy version control. They are a natural fit for blogs.

It has never been easier and cheaper to host you own private blog. [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/) lists the top open-source static site generators and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows you to host your static website for free!

### Curious Observer
This is not my first blog (and likely not my last) but it's the first time that I have managed to create a blog that feels like it does not limit my creativity and productivity. The following should not be seen as a how to, it should just serve as an inspiration for your own blog ideas.

The requirements I set for this blog were demanding and included:

* Code snippets with syntax highlighting
* Embed the results of computations like plots
* Mathematical figures
* Bibliographic citations
* Footnotes

Above all: ease of use should come first. It's not that all of the above is not possible with your typical blog, but it involves a lot of work for every single post.

### Technology

I did not do much research about different static site generators before building this blog and that was a mistake. I choose [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because of it's (supposedly) good integration with Github and it's wide adoption in the community I'm following.

During development I realised that Jekyll alone will not be able to satisfy my requirements without additional plugins. The automatic build that Github Pages provides for Jekyll-powered sites only works for sites with a limited number of [allowed plugins](https://pages.github.com/versions/).

> Don't rely on the Jekyll integration that Github pages provides

Don't get my wrong, Jekyll is awesome and I am still use Jekyll to generate this site. However, due to my limited knowledge of Ruby I would likely choose a different static site generator, like the Haskell based [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), in the future. A personal blog in a sense reflects your preferences as a developer.

#### Code snippets

Keep in mind that syntax highlighting generally depends on the Markdown processor you use. By default, Jekyll uses [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) and has built-in support for code snippets with syntax highlighting. The only thing you have to do is to [find or create the right syntax highlighting theme](https://github.com/richleland/pygments-css). Additionally, Jekyll also offers tags to provide syntax highlighting independent from your Markdown processor.

```python
print("Hello syntax highlighting.")
```

#### Embedded computations

Embedding the output of computations in a beautiful and simple to create way is a bit harder. Fortunately there already exists a tool that can be used for this job, it's called [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/). The mission was the combine Jekyll and Jupyter somehow. I actually had to write a small plugin to make it work. First contact with Ruby, yay üëç

{% jupyter_notebook sample.ipynb %}

Unfortunately there are some differences in the way Jupyter highlights syntax with [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) and how Jekyll highlights syntax with [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge). Jekyll offers tags to highlight your syntax with {% raw %}`{% highlight %}`{% endraw %}, that transform your syntax before the Markdown processor kicks in. In principle you could also use Pygments with Jekyll because Jekyll supports [pygments.rb](https://github.com/tmm1/pygments.rb), but it did not work for me and would likely require different versions of Python for Jupyter and pygments.rb.

Eventually, I decided to not use Jekyll's syntax highlighting and let my Markdown processor do the work. This meant that I had to align the styles of both highlighters and it turned to work O.K.

#### Figures, Citations, Footnotes

There is actually a Markdown processor that does all those things and much, much more. [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a Haskell based *universal document converter* and it's truly universal. With it you can translate from and to numerous different file formats. You could easily create a beautifully typeset PDF version of every post for example.

Pandoc is not officially supported by Jekyll, which meant that I had to write a small plugin again. The plugin basically just forwards Jekyll's site options to the Pandoc CLI and uses it to transform Markdown files to HTML.

Pandoc basically allows you to write a research article with all formalities and transform it to plain old HTML. I would love to see blogs that publish well-researched articles in the future. [Distill](https://distill.pub/) and [NextJournal](https://nextjournal.com/) show that even scientific publishing will be web-based in the future.

#### Development workflow

Once you free yourself from the limited Jekyll build that Github pages provides, you are free to use whatever tool you want.

I decided to improve my development workflow by using [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to bundle all style and script assets. Webpack enables you to use it's [development server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) to hot-reload all Webpack resources. Webpack can also automatically reload your page once files generated from Jekyll change.

Finally, with continuous integration tools like [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) you can remotely build your blog, run tests and deploy to Github pages. It's free if your blog is open-source!
